# ai-passwords

This is a collection of password lists in which I have trained various deep learning algorithms to try to come up with passwords.

* **gpt-2-small**: Using minimaxir's [gpt-2-simple](https://github.com/minimaxir/gpt-2-simple) with GPT2-small and some of the [hashes.org](https://hashes.org) "founds" dataset. This was a test run and thus is not as rigourous as I would have liked. I am now re-running the model finetuning and generation from scratch in order to have a publishable training set, model checkpoint, and unique list.
